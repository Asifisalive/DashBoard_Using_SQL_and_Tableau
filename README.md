# DashBoard_Using_SQL_and_Tableau

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a financial loan dataset using SQL queries and visualizing the insights with a Tableau dashboard. The analysis includes various metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts collected, interest rates, and loan statuses.

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries are designed to extract key metrics and insights from the financial_loan_dataset. The queries perform the following functions:

  * Create and Use Database: Initialize and switch to the project database.

  * Show Tables: List all tables within the database.

  * Retrieve Dataset: Fetch the entire financial_loan_dataset for analysis.

  * Total Loan Applications: Count the total number of loan applications.

  * Total Funded Amount: Sum the total loan amounts circulated in the market.

  * Total Amount Collected: Sum the total payments received back by the bank.

  * Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate of loans.

  * Average DTI Rate: Calculate the average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.

  * Loan Status Breakdown: Identify the status of loans (e.g., Fully Paid, Current,   Charged Off).

  * Good Loan Applications: Count the number of fully paid or current loan   
  applications.

  * Bad Loan Applications: Count the number of charged-off loan applications.

  * Good Loan Percentage: Calculate the percentage of good loans.

  * Bad Loan Percentage: Calculate the percentage of bad loans.

  * Funded Amount by Loan Status: Sum the loan amounts by status (good vs. bad   loans).

  * Amount Received by Loan Status: Sum the payments received by loan status.

## Tableau Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard visualizes the metrics derived from the SQL queries, providing a comprehensive view of the financial loan dataset. The dashboard includes:

### 1.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

  * Total Loan Applications

  * Total Funded Amount

  * Total Amount Collected

  * Average Interest Rate

  * Average DTI Rate

### 2.Loan Status Breakdown:

  * A pie chart and bar chart showing the distribution of loan statuses (Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off).

### 3.Loan Quality Analysis:

  * Good Loan Percentage 
  
  * Bad Loan Percentage.

  * Total Good Loan Applications

  * Total Bad Loan Applications

### 4.Funded Amounts Comparison:

  * Bar chart comparing the funded amounts of good loans vs. bad loans.

### 5.Amount Received by Loan Status:

  * Bar chart comparing the amounts received back by the bank for good loans vs. bad loans.

## How to Use

### 1.SQL Queries:

* Run the provided SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment to extract the necessary metrics from the financial_loan_dataset.

### 2.Tableau Dashboard:

* Use the extracted data to create a Tableau dashboard. The dashboard templates and configuration details are included in the repository.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the financial loan dataset, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on key metrics and visualizations.
